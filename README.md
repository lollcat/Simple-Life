# Simple-Life

Once this works, next step is: can we run the loop on many different servers, with the updated info getting sent to a central boss



## Files:
  - **main.py**: This is the file to run (it is short & sweet)
    - If it is sucessful it returns a messy list of arrays, with results from running simulations
  - **Simulator.fsd**: Contains the simulation file (if you open it in the GUI you should see a reactor)
  - **Requirements.txt**: Contains required python packages
    - besides these packages you also need COCO simulator https://www.cocosimulator.org/index_download.html
  - **Investigation.ipynb**: Just me fiddling around in the jupyter notebook to make sure things worked before I wrote main.py
